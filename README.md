# Veripy

A production-ready auto-active verification system for Python, similar to Dafny and Verus.

## Overview

Veripy transforms Python code verification from a work-in-progress into a production-ready system with automatic invariant inference, comprehensive error reporting, and a professional CLI.

## Soundness note

Veripy is **not sound for full Python** today. The core VC engine is intended to be sound for a restricted, “verification-oriented” subset (roughly: side-effect-free code over `int`/`bool` plus mathematical arrays, with structured `if`/`while`, and user-supplied invariants), and it rejects or approximates many Python features (exceptions, dynamic dispatch, aliasing/mutation semantics of real lists/dicts/objects, etc.).

Recent work is moving toward a Dafny/Boogie-style explicit heap model for **aliasing + mutation** (lists/dicts/fields as references) and for **exception safety** (e.g., bounds and `div/mod` by zero become proof obligations). This is still a work in progress and many Python features remain unsupported.

## Key Features

### Auto-Active Verification
- Automatic loop invariant inference
- Type-based constraint generation
- Arithmetic lemma automation
- Multiple inference strategies (NONE, SIMPLE, AGGRESSIVE, FULL)

### Production Readiness
- Professional CLI with multiple commands
- Rich terminal output with syntax highlighting
- JSON output for CI/CD
- Comprehensive error reporting with counterexamples
- Source location tracking

### Recursive Functions
- Termination checking with decreases clauses
- Tail recursion detection
- Call graph analysis

## Installation

```bash
pip install veripy
```

For development:
```bash
make install-dev
```

## Usage

### Basic Verification
```python
import veripy as vp

vp.enable_verification()

@vp.verify(requires=['x > 0'], ensures=['ans == x * 2'])
def double(x: int) -> int:
    return x * 2

vp.verify_all()
```

### CLI Usage
```bash
# Verify files
veripy verify file.py

# With counterexamples and statistics
veripy verify --counterexample --statistics file.py

# JSON output for CI/CD
veripy verify --output json file.py
```

### Auto-Active Features
```python
from veripy.auto_active import auto_infer_invariants

invariants = auto_infer_invariants({
    "loop_var": "i",
    "init": 0,
    "condition": "i < n",
    "body": []
})
```
